**Unit 6: Historical, Cultural, and Social Analysis** <span
id="6"></span> 
*In the middle to late twentieth century, many art historians have
focused on the historical, social, economic, and cultural context in
which art is made.  Within these frameworks, three major methodologies
emerged that have also been espoused by scholars working in other
disciplines: Marxism, Feminism, and post-colonialism.  After completing
this unit, you will be able to explain the major elements of these
methodologies and how Marxism, Feminism, and post-colonialism can be
used to analyze art.*

    of its economic base.  Both Neo-Marxist and non-Marxist art
    historians focus on the political and social beliefs behind art.
