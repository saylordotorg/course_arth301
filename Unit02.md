**Unit 2: Visual Description and Stylistic and Biographical Analysis**
<span id="2"></span> 
*First, this unit explains how to write a visual description and
stylistic analysis of an artwork.  It then examines the methodology of
Formalism by first focusing on Heinrich Wölfflin’s (1864-1945) work and
then on later mid-twentieth century Formalists.  Although Wölfflin was
interested in the cultural context in which stylistic changes occurred,
later twentieth-century Formalist art historians and critics combined
his approach with certain elements of connoisseurship to create a
methodology that focused solely on the artworks’ formal properties. The
result was analysis containing highly nuanced formal descriptions of art
and artistic movements detached from larger claims about the culture in
which they were created.  The unit concludes by looking at Giorgio
Vasari’s (1511-1574)“Lives of Artists” and biographical analysis.*

     Instructions: Choose one of the two groups of artworks below and
    write a two to three page double-spaced stylistic analysis of the
    paintings or sculptures.  (Note that the numbers in parentheses are
    the accession numbers and can also be used to find artworks in the
    museum’s collection database.)  
        
     1) Claude Monet: “Camille Monet on a Garden Bench (2002.62.1),”
    “Camille Monet in the Garden at Argenteuil (2000.93.1)”, and “La

    should be based on a comparison of what the artworks look like. 
    When writing your stylistic analysis, be sure to consider the
    following: size, format, what materials were used, how they were
    used, what is represented, and how it is represented.  Organize your
    analysis around an introduction that includes a strong thesis
    statement, a body with complete paragraphs that have topic
    sentences, and a conclusion.  Remember to carefully proofread your
    essay to check for any grammar and spelling errors.  After you are
    finished, please visit Marjorie Munsterberg’s Writing About Art:
