**Unit 5: Psychoanalysis** <span id="5"></span> 
*This unit explores the use of psychoanalytic concepts in art historical
scholarship. It begins by examining Freud and how some of his
concepts—including his ideas of consciousness, the unconsciousness, and
Object Relations Theory—be used to analyze artworks.  It then turns to
the Lacanian concepts of “the gaze” and “object petit a,” which art
historians have used in their analyses.  After completing this unit, you
will be able to explain the major elements of psychoanalysis and how
this methodology can be used to analyze a work of art. *
