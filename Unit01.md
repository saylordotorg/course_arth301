**Unit 1: What is Art? What is an Artist? What is Art History?** <span
id="1"></span> 
*This unit first introduces the student to the discipline of art history
and discusses how the conception of the discipline’s central
focus—art—has changed over time.  It then focuses on the aesthetic
theories of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770-1831), the most
important of several nineteenth-century German philosophers whose
theories are associated with the birth of modern art history.  Although
aesthetics, art history, and art criticism are technically separate
areas of study, writers from all three fields, more often than not, have
made contributions to the development of art historical methodologies. 
After completing this unit, you will be able to explain how the concept
of art has changed overtime, the differences among aesthetics, art
criticism, and art history, and Hegel’s aesthetic theories.*

     Instructions: Please read this text an introduction to Hegel’s
    aesthetic theory.  Art history as we know it today originated in
    nineteenth-century Germany.  Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel was the
    German philosopher whose aesthetic theories were most important to
    modern art history’s development.  He outlined three steps in art’s
    historical development: the Symbolic, the Classical, and the
    Romantic.  Additionally, Hegel’s lectures on aesthetics are
    important because in them he tried to determine why art was
    historically and socially specific and why art changes over time.
