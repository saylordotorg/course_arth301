**Unit 3: Connoisseurship and Technical Analysis** <span id="3"></span> 
*This unit looks at the development of connoisseurship and technical
analysis. Connoisseurship focuses on establishing the authenticity and
authorship of a work of art based on its size, condition, medium, and
technique while also considering contemporary customs, fashion, and
literature.  Traditionally, this type of judgment was largely based on
the connoisseur’s personal intuition.  Technical analysis developed out
of traditional connoisseurship, and it is an interdisciplinary field
using modern scientific analysis to study, preserve, and conserve
artworks.*
