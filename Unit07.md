**Unit 7: Semiotics** <span id="7"></span> 
*Semiotic theory originally developed in the field of linguistics and
has been used by art historians to question the very system whereby
meaning and interpretation is created.  In contrast to the other
methodologies you have studied so far, semiotic theory allows for many
different interpretations of an artwork because it argues that meaning
is created in the act of viewing.  After completing this unit, you will
be able to explain the major elements of semiotic theory and how they
can be used to analyze works of art.*

**Unit 7 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 15 hours to complete.

**Unit7 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:

-   Identify and explain major elements of semiotic theory and how they
    can be used to analyze art.
