Course Syllabus for "ARTH301: Art Historical Methodologies"
-----------------------------------------------------------

This course is an introduction to the major methodologies that have been
and are used by art historians. Although not a history of art history
per se, it is organized in a roughly chronological order that traces
major methodological developments within the discipline from the birth
of art history in the nineteenth century through the late twentieth
century. By focusing on several outstanding historical and critical
readings, as well as secondary discussions of different types of art
historical analysis, the student will be introduced to some of the major
methodologies that have shaped the field: formalism, biographical
analysis, connoisseurship, technical analysis, iconographical analysis,
psychoanalysis, Marxism and the social history of art, feminism,
post-colonialism, and semiotics. The course will also examine how
artworks are displayed in modern art museums. After completing this
course, you will be able to explain the strengths and weaknesses of
different art historical methodologies and explain how they can be used
to analyze works of art.

been made to supply links to images and discussions of works that the
student may be unfamiliar with, you are encouraged to briefly research
works discussed in the readings that you have not seen or do not know
much about. You should also note that many of these readings are
theoretical and therefore very dense, so you may have to read over them,
or at least sections of them, several times.
